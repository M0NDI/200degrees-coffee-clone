        "Mijane Woresa has worked in coffee for over 30 years. He recently started a new export company with his sons to allow them to offer lots directly from his processing stations. As a family owned business, Mijane and his sons emphasize social impact in the communities where they source coffee. They have invested in more localized cherry collection sites to reduce the transportation cost for smaller producers. They have also contributed to road construction projects that make travel for everyone a bit easier and they invest in school infrastructure projects. On arrival at the mill cherries are carefully sorted by handed and floated to remove defects. The cherry is depulped and fermented in tanks for 48 hours before being channel washed to sort by density. The fully washed coffee is then dried in the sun on raised bed for 12-15 days.",

        "This coffee is harvested from approximately 500 smallholders surrounding the Shantawene village. The coffee trees in this region may be over 200 years old. The Abore mill is owned and operated by the Dukamo family, who have become leaders in high quality coffee production. In 2020 at the inaugural Cup of Excellence of Ethiopia, one of their coffees took 7th place - an enormous accomplishment. This lot is naturally processed. Ripe cherry is picked and then floated in water to remove any defective cherries. It is laid in the sun for up to 14 days to dry on raised beds, being meticulously raked and turned to prevent the growth of mold. This method produces a fruit forward flavor profile that is vibrant and juicy.",
